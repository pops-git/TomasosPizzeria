# TomasosPizzeria
School project where I had to create a website for a pizzeria. Includes interface for customers and admin.

You can check it out by logging in as either a regular/premium user or as an admin. (https://tomasospizzeria20210224002236.azurewebsites.net/)

You will be automatically set to regular when you create a new account.
Difference between regular and premium is that premium has discounts (10pts per course bought, 100pts gives one free course. 3+ courses in an order gives 20% discount).

You can try the following logins if you wish:

Username: regular

Password: Regular123!

Username: premium

Password: Premium123!

Username: admin
